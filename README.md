This is the source code for Robert Plummer's course on Scrimba for brain.js. 

The code is meant to be run in a browser.
There are question and answers as bonus in some files.

## Things to remember:
1.  file: index.html and file: counter.html almost the same except for the version of brain.js .
2.  index.html references version 1.2.6 of brain.js ,
     counter.html references version 1.6.0.
3.  normalization.html is used for the file: stockPredictor.js .
