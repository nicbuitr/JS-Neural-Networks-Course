# Brain.js Course Source Code

This is the source code for Robert Plummer's course on Scrimba for brain.js. The code is meant to be run in a browser.
Some files include bonus question answers and others don't.

index.html and counter.html are the same, but counter uses newer code for brain.js. index.html references version 1.2.6(I think?) of brain.js, while counter.html references version 1.6.0.

normalization.html is used for the stockPredictor.js file.
